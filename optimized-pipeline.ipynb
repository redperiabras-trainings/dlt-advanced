    "# **Homework: Speed up your pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the public **Jaffle Shop API** to build a `dlt` pipeline and apply everything you've learned about performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chunking\n",
    "- Parallelism\n",
    "- Buffer control\n",
    "- File rotation\n",
    "- Worker tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to **make the pipeline as fast as possible**, while keeping the results correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What you’ll need**\n",
    "\n",
    "- API base: `https://jaffle-shop.scalevector.ai/api/v1`\n",
    "- Docs: [https://jaffle-shop.scalevector.ai/docs](https://jaffle-shop.scalevector.ai/docs)\n",
    "- Start with these endpoints:\n",
    "  - `/customers`\n",
    "  - `/orders`\n",
    "  - `/products`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of them returns **paged responses** — so you'll need to handle pagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What to implement**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract** from the API using `dlt`\n",
    "   - Use `dlt.resource` and [`RESTClient`](https://dlthub.com/docs/devel/general-usage/http/rest-client) with proper pagination\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply all performance techniques**\n",
    "   - Group resources into sources\n",
    "   - Yield **chunks/pages**, not single rows\n",
    "   - Use `parallelized=True`\n",
    "   - Set `EXTRACT__WORKERS`, `NORMALIZE__WORKERS`, and `LOAD__WORKERS`\n",
    "   - Tune buffer sizes and enable **file rotation**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measure performance**\n",
    "   - Time the extract, normalize, and load stages separately\n",
    "   - Compare a naive version vs. optimized version\n",
    "   - Log thread info or `pipeline.last_trace` if helpful\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Deliverables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Share your code as a Google Colab or [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) in Homework Google Form. **This step is required for certification.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It should include:\n",
    "- Working pipeline for at least 2 endpoints\n",
    "- Before/after timing comparison\n",
    "- A short explanation of what changes made the biggest difference if there're any differences"
